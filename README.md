If you are looking to integrate LUX into an existing Rails, Drupal, or even JSFiddle, check out
our documentation for [How to Install LUX](https://pulibrary.github.io/lux/docs/#!/Installing%20LUX).

To ride the bleeding edge, pull directly from the GitHub in package.json dependencies:

```
...
"dependencies": {
  "lux-design-system": "pulibrary/lux"
}
...
```

To use an older version, add pin the npm version you want to your package.json dependencies:

```
...
"dependencies": {
  "lux-design-system": "^0.0.0"
}
...
```

To publish a new version to npm:

1.  Pull latest master with merged changes.
2.  Run `yarn build:system`
3.  Commit generated files
4.  Bump the npm version with `npm version {semantic version number}`
5.  Run `npm publish`
6.  Push fresh commits to master
7.  Create a Github Release tag with change log
